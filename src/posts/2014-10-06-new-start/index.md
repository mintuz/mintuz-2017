Starting next Monday I will be joining the BBC as a web developer in the content discovery department, meaning I will be leaving [Forepoint](http://forepoint.co.uk) on Friday after two years of being apart of the web team. I would like to thank [Forepoint](http://forepoint.co.uk) for making me feel apart of the team from the very start and some people will be greatly missed. Without [Forepoint](http://forepoint.co.uk) taking a chance with me, my career could be very different right now and I am greatful for having the chance to follow my passion.  [work] I have enjoyed working on various websites within the nuclear, defence and public sectors including projects like [derwentsidehomes](http://www.derwentsidehomes.co.uk), [MagnoxÂ ltd](http://magnoxsites.co.uk), [s4bmanchester](http://s4bmanchester.co.uk) and [Moto](http://moto-way.com) where I have been given the chance to learn and develop my skills as a developer and more importantly a person. Forepoint are also recruiting for new web developers so if you are interested, be sure to visit the [careers section](http://forepoint.co.uk/careers/).
