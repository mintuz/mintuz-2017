Having the ability to retrieve data from the server without specifying a REST endpoint is amazing, it allows you to scale your data model easily.</p>\\n<p>The talk by Jafar Husain “Falcor: One Model Everywhere” demonstrated the way Falcor does it really well.

My take from his talk is that Falcor is better for smaller applications where the data model is known and that you should use GraphQL where the model may change and need to scale.</p>\\n<p>Falcor is less prescriptive, has fewer concepts and a smaller file size &#x3C; 50%. It takes a segment of the model you defined and returns it from the data source.

Bertrand Karerangabo and Evan Schultz demonstrated a neat way of using redux middleware to track analytics without much configuration. Because Redux uses a single store and provides a single location for state changes, their middleware hooks into the redux event loop and its from there we can learn a lot about a user and what current state the application is in. So simple but so powerful that until this point I had overlooked the possibilities of using Redux for analytics.</p>\\n<h2>Lightning Talks</h2>\\n<p>Phil Holden, you were a beast. demonstrating <a href=\\\"https://github.com/philholden/redux-swarmlog\\\">redux-swarmlog</a>. A super simple way of writing distributed Redux applications. The <a href=\\\"https://github.com/reactjs/redux\\\">Redux</a> action log is persisted in an IndexDB and synced with other peers via a <a href=\\\"https://github.com/mafintosh/webrtc-swarm\\\">WebRTC Swarm</a> using <a href=\\\"https://github.com/substack/swarmlog\\\">Swarmlog</a>. (honestly didn’t just copy and paste that from the README file :P)</p>\\n<p>Ken Wheeler demonstrated <a href=\\\"https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory\\\">Victory</a>, a cross platform charting library. I’ve been looking for a charting library for a while and this will definitely be used in my new application I am writing in React Native.</p>\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>I had an amazing time at React Europe 2016 and certainly recommend going next year if you can. Lots of insight, Lots of swag and great atmosphere. Now it’s time to play with all these new toys.

I think the picture below demonstrates how intense it got. Talks should be composed of quick and snappy bit’s of information which can easily be digested. Then again I may be just stupid because people on Twitter seemed to have enjoy the talks.</p>\\n<p>I am however going to re-watch these talks to make sure it wasn’t just the long day that caused me to feel overwhelmed. I’m sure there’s some value in these talks I just couldn’t see it on the day.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/CkAejpiUYAEvOOg-fb1c26c7f2e42333ee0e71152afbc8aa-a5ccc.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 133.33333333333331%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"CkAejpiUYAEvOOg\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/CkAejpiUYAEvOOg-fb1c26c7f2e42333ee0e71152afbc8aa-f8fb9.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/CkAejpiUYAEvOOg-fb1c26c7f2e42333ee0e71152afbc8aa-e8976.jpg 148w,\\n/static/CkAejpiUYAEvOOg-fb1c26c7f2e42333ee0e71152afbc8aa-63df2.jpg 295w,\\n/static/CkAejpiUYAEvOOg-fb1c26c7f2e42333ee0e71152afbc8aa-f8fb9.jpg 590w,\\n/static/CkAejpiUYAEvOOg-fb1c26c7f2e42333ee0e71152afbc8aa-85e3d.jpg 885w,\\n/static/CkAejpiUYAEvOOg-fb1c26c7f2e42333ee0e71152afbc8aa-a5ccc.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<h2>Redux Analytics</h2>\\n<p>Before this talk I didn’t really think about how much of a pain it is to set up analytics in an application but my general approach was to hook into some sort of event such as a click event and then send some data from the client to the server. Bertrand Karerangabo and Evan Schultz demonstrated a neat way of using redux middleware to track analytics without much configuration. Because Redux uses a single store and provides a single location for state changes, their middleware hooks into the redux event loop and its from there we can learn a lot about a user and what current state the application is in. So simple but so powerful that until this point I had overlooked the possibilities of using Redux for analytics.</p>\\n<h2>Lightning Talks</h2>\\n<p>Phil Holden, you were a beast. demonstrating <a href=\\\"https://github.com/philholden/redux-swarmlog\\\">redux-swarmlog</a>. A super simple way of writing distributed Redux applications. The <a href=\\\"https://github.com/reactjs/redux\\\">Redux</a> action log is persisted in an IndexDB and synced with other peers via a <a href=\\\"https://github.com/mafintosh/webrtc-swarm\\\">WebRTC Swarm</a> using <a href=\\\"https://github.com/substack/swarmlog\\\">Swarmlog</a>. (honestly didn’t just copy and paste that from the README file :P)</p>\\n<p>Ken Wheeler demonstrated <a href=\\\"https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory\\\">Victory</a>, a cross platform charting library. I’ve been looking for a charting library for a while and this will definitely be used in my new application I am writing in React Native.</p>\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>I had an amazing time at React Europe 2016 and certainly recommend going next year if you can. Lots of insight, Lots of swag and great atmosphere. Now it’s time to play with all these new toys.
