Bertrand Karerangabo and Evan Schultz demonstrated a neat way of using redux middleware to track analytics without much configuration. Because Redux uses a single store and provides a single location for state changes, their middleware hooks into the redux event loop and its from there we can learn a lot about a user and what current state the application is in.
